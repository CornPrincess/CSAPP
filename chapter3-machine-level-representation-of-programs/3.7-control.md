# 3.6 Control

Some constructs in C such as conditionals, loops, and switches, require conditional execution, where the sequence of operations that get performed depends on the outcomes of tests applied to the data. Machine code provides two basic low-level mechanisms for implementing conditional behavior: it tests data values and then alters either the control flow or the data flow based on the results of these tests.\
C语言中的某些结构，比如条件语句，循环语句和分支语句，要有条件的执行，根据数据测试的结果来决定操作执行的顺序。**机器代码提供两种基本的低级机制来实现条件的行为：测试数据值，然后根据测试的结果来改变控制流或者数据流。**

Data-dependent control flow is the more general and more common approach for implementing conditional behavior. Normally, both statements in C and instructions in machine code are executed sequentially, in the order they appear in the program. The execution order of a set of machine code instructions can be altered with a jump instruction, indicating that control should pass to some other part of the program, possibly contingent on the result of some test. The compiler must generate instruction sequences that build upon this low-level mechanism to implement the control constructs of C.\
**与数据相关的控制流**是实现有条件行为的更一般和更常见的方法。通常，C语言中的语句和机器代码中的指令都是按照他们程序中出现的次序，顺序执行的。用 `jump` 指令可以改变一组机器代码指令的执行顺序， `jump` 指令指定控制应该被传递到程序的某个其他部分，可能是依赖于某个测试的结果。编译器必须产生构建在这种低级基础之上的指令序列，来实现 C 语言的控制结构。

### 3.6.1 Condition Codes

In addition to the integer registers, the CPU maintains a set of `single-bit condition code registers`describing attributes of the most recent arithmetic or logical operation. These register can then be tested to perform conditional branches. These condition codes are the most useful:&#x20;

* CF: Carry flag. The most recent operation generated a carry out of the most significant bit. Used to detect overflow for unsigned operations.
* ZF: Zero flag. The most recent operation yielded zero.
* SF: Sign flag. The most recent operation yielded a negative value.
* OP: Overflow flag. The most recent operation caused a two's-complement overflow--either negative or positive.

除了整数寄存器，CPU还维护着一组单个位的条件码寄存器，他们 描述最近的算术或逻辑操作的属性。可以检测这些寄存器来执行条件分支指令。最常用的条件码有：

* CF：进位标志。最近的操作使最高位产生了进位。可以用来检查无符号操作的溢出
* ZF：零标志。最近的操作的出的结果为0
* SF：符号标志。最近的操作得到的结果为负数
* OF：溢出标志。最近的操作导致一个补码溢出——正溢出或负溢出

The `leaq` instruction does not alter any condition codes, since it is intended to be used in address computations. In additional to the setting of condition codes by the figure3.10, there are two instruction classes(having 8-, 16-, 32-, and 64-bit forms) that set condition codes without altering any other registers. The `CMP` instructions set the condition codes according to the differences of their two operands. They behave in the same way as `SUB` instructions, _except that they set the condition codes without updating their destinations. _The `TEST` instructions behave in the same manner as the `AND` instructions, _except that they set the condition codes without altering their destinations._\
`leaq` 指令不改变任何条件码，因为它是用来进行地址计算的。除此之外，Figure 3.10列出的所有指令都会设置条件码。除了 Figure3.10 列出的指令，还有两类指定，它们只设置条件码而不改变任何其他寄存器。CMP指令根据两个操作数之差来设置条件码，CMP指令与 SUB 指令的行为是一样的。TEST 指令的行为与 AND 指令一样，除了它们只设置条件码而不改变目的寄存器的值。

### 3.6.2  Accessing the Condition Codes

Rather than reading the condition codes directly, there are three common ways of using the condition codes:

* we can set a single byte to 0 or 1 depending on some combination of the condition codes
* we can conditionally jump to some other part of the program
* we can conditionally transfer data

条件码通常不会直接读取，常用的使用方法有三种：

* 可以根据条件码的某种组合，将一个字节设置为0或1
* 可以条件跳转到程序的某个其他的部分
* 可以有条件地传送数据

### 3.6.3 Jump Instructions

A `jump` instruction can cause the execution to switch to a completely new position in the program. These jump destinations are generally indicated in assembly code by a label.\
跳转指令会导致执行切换到程序中一个全新的位置。在汇编代码中，这些挑战的目的地通常是一个标号知名。

The `jmp` instruction jumps unconditionally. it can be a `direct jump`, where the jump target is encoded as part of the instruction, or an `indirect jump,` where the jump target is read from a register or a memory location.

### 3.6.4 Jump Instruction Encodings

Understanding how the targets of jump instructions are encoded will become important when we study linking in Chapter7. There are several different encodings for jumps, but some of the most commonly used ones are `PC relative`. That is, they encodings the difference between the address of the target instruction and the address of the instruction immediately following the jump. These offsets can be encoded using 1, 2 or 4 bytes. A second encoding method is to give an `"absolute" address`, using 4 bytes to directly specify the target.

The value of the program counter when performing PC-relative addressing is the address of the instruction following the jump, not that of the jump itself. This convention dates back to early implementations, when the processor would update the program counter as its first step in executing an instruction.\
当执行PC相对寻址时，程序计数器的值时跳转指令后面的那条指令的地址，而不是跳转指令本身的地址。**这种惯例可以追溯到早期的实现，当时的处理器会将更新程序计数器作为执行一条指令的第一步。**

### 3.6.5 Implementing Conditional Branches with Conditional Control

The most general way to translate conditional expressions and statements from C into machine code is to use combinations of conditional and unconditional jumps.

The general form of an if-else statement in C is given by the template

```c
if (test-expr)
    then-statement
else 
    else-statement
```

where `test-expr` is an `integer expression` that evaluates either to zero(interpreted as meaning false) or to a nonzero value(interpreted as meaning true).Only one of the two branch statements is executed.

### 3.6.6 Implementing Conditional Branches with Conditional Moves

The conventional way to implement conditional operations is through a **conditional transfer of control**, where the program follows one execution path when a condition holds and another when it does not. **This mechanism is simple and general, but it can be very inefficient on modern processors.**\
实现条件操作的传统方法是通过使用控制的条件转移。当条件满足时，程序沿着一条执行路径执行，而当条件不满足时，就走另一条路径。这种机制简单而通用，但是在现代处理器上，它可能会非常低效。

An alternate strategy is through a **condition transfer of data**. This approach computes both outcomes of a conditional operation and then selects one based on whether or not the condition holds. This strategy makes sense only in restricted cases, but it can then be implemented by a simple **conditional move instruction that is better matched to the performance characteristics of modern processors.** here, we examine this strategy and its implementation with x86-64.\
一种替代的策略是使用数据的条件转移。这种方法计算一个条件操作的两种结果，然后再根据条件是否满足从其中选取一个。只有在一些受限制的情况下，这种策略才可行，但是如果可行，就可以用一条简单的条件传送指令来实现它，条件传送指令更符合现代处理器的性能特性，我们将介绍这一策略，以及它在x86-64上 的实现。

To understand why code based on conditional data transfers can outperform code based on conditional control transfers, we must understand something about how modern processors operate. processors achieve high performance through pipelining. Processors employ sophisticated branch prediction logic to try to guess whether or not each jump instruction will be followed. Mispredicting a jump, on the other hand, requires that the processor discard much of the work it has already done on future instructions and filling the pipeline with instructions starting at the correct location. As we will see, such a misprediction can incur as serious penalty ,say, 15-30 clock cycles of wasted effort, causing a serious degradation of program performance.

Overall. then, we see that conditional data transfers offer an alternative strategy to conditional control transfers for implementing conditional operations. **They can only be sued in restricted cases, but these cases are fairly common and provide a much better match to the operation of modern processors.**

### 3.6.7 Loops

C provides several looping constructs--namely, do-while, while, and for. No corresponding instructions exist in machine code. Instead, combinations of conditional tests and jumps are used to implement the effect of loops. Gcc and other compilers generate loop code based on the two basic loop patterns. We will study the translation of loops as a progression.

### 3.6.8 Switch Statements

A switch statement provides a multiway branching capability based on the value of an integer index. They are particularly useful when dealing with tests where there can be a large number of possible outcomes. Not only do they make C code more readable, but they also allow an efficient implementation using a data structure called a **jump table**. _A jump table is an array where entry i is the address of a code segment implementing the action the program should take when the switch index equals i._ The code performs an array reference into the jump table using the switch index to determine the target for a jump instruction. The advantage of using a jump table over a long sequence of if-else statements is that the time taken to perform the switch is independent of the number of switch cases, Gcc selects the method of translating a switch statement based on the number of cases and the sparsity of the case values, Jump tables are used when there are a number of cases(e.g. four or more) and they span a small range of values.\
switch语句可以根据一个整数索引值进行多重分支。在处理具有多种可能结果的测试时，这种语句特别有用，他们不仅提高了C代码的可读性，而且通过使用跳转表这种数据结构使得实现更加高效。跳转表是一个数组，表项i是一个代码段的地址，这个代码段实现当开关索引值等于i时程序应该采取的动作。**程序代码用开关索引值来执行一个跳转表内的数组引用。确定跳转指令的目标。和使用一组很长的if-else语句相比，跳转表的优点是执行开关语句的时间与开关情况的数量无关。GCC更加开关情况的数量和开关情况值的稀疏程度来翻译开关语句。当开关情况数量比较多(四个或更多)，并且值的范围跨度比较小时，就会使用跳转表。**
