# 3.7 Procedures

Procedures are a key abstraction in software. they provide a way to package code that implements some functionality with a designated set of arguments and an optional return value. The function can then be invoked from different points in a program. Well-designed software uses  procedures as an abstraction mechanism, hiding the detailed implementation of some action while providing a clear and concise interface definition of what values will be computed and what effects the procedure will have on the program state. Procedures come in many guises in different programming languages--functions, methods, subroutines, handlers, and so on-- but they all share a general set of features.\
过程是软件中一种很重要的抽象，它提供了一种封装代码的方式，用一组指定的参数和一种可选的返回值实现了某种功能，。然后，可以在程序中不同的地方调用这个函数。设计良好的软件用过程作为抽象机制，隐藏某个行为的具体实现心，同时又提供清晰简洁的接口定义，说明要计算的是哪些值，过程会对程序产生什么样的影响。不同编程语言中，过程的形式多样：函数（function），方法，子例程，处理函数等等，但是他们有一些共有的特性。

### 3.7.1 The Run-Time Stack&#x20;

A program can manage the storage required by its procedures using a stack, where the stack and the program registers store the information required for passing control and data, and for allocating memory. As P calls Q, control and data information are added to the end of the stack. This information gets deallocated when P returns.\
When an x86-64 procedure requires storage beyond what it can hold in registers, it allocated space on the stack. This region is referred to as the procedure's stack frame. The stack frames for most procedures are of fixed size, allocated at the beginning of the procedures. Some procedures, however, require variable-size frames.\

### 3.7.2 Control Transfer

Passing control from the function P to function Q involves simply setting the program counter(PC) to the starting address of the code for Q. However, when it later comes time for Q to return, the processor must have some record of the code location where it should resume the execution of P. This information is recorded in x86-64 machines by invoking procedure Q with the instruction _call Q_. This instruction pushed an address A onto the stack and sets the PC to the beginning of Q, The pushed address A is referred to as the _return address_ and is computed as the address of the instruction immediately following the call instruction. The counterpart instruction ret pops an address A off the stack and sets the PC to A.\
将控制从函数P 转移到函数Q只需要简单地把程序计数器PC设置为Q带啊秣的起始位置。不过，当稍后从Q返回的时候，处理器必须记录好它需要继续P的执行的代码位置，在x86-64机器中，这个信息是用指令`call Q `调用过程Q来记录的。**该指令会把地址A压入栈中，并把PC设为Q的起始位置。压入的地址A被称作返回地址，是紧跟 call 指令后面的那条指令的地址。对应的指令 `ret `会从栈中弹出地址A，并把PC设置为A。**

### 3.7.3 Data Transfer

In addition to passing control to a procedure when called, and then back again when the procedure returns, procedure calls may involve passing data as arguments, and returning from a procedure may also involve returning a value. With x86-64, most of these data passing to and from procedures take place via **registers.  When procedure  P calls procedure Q, the code for P must first copy the arguments into the proper registers. Similarly, when Q returns back to P, the code for P can access the returned value in register `%rax`. In this section, we explore these conventions in greater detail.**

### 3.7.4 Local Storage on the Stack

Most of the procedure examples we have seen so far did not require any local storage beyond what could be held in registers. At times, however, local data must be stored in memory. common cases of this include these:

* These are not enough registers to held all of the local data
* The address operator `&` is applied to a local variable,  and hence we must be able to generate an address for it.
* Some of the local variables are arrays or structures and hence must be accessed by array or structure references.&#x20;
